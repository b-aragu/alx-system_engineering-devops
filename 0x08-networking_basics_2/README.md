1. **localhost/127.0.0.1:**
   - **localhost:** It is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access it. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface.
   - **127.0.0.1:** This IP address is the loopback address, and it always refers to the localhost or the current device. When you access 127.0.0.1 or "localhost," you are communicating with the local machine itself without going through a network.

2. **0.0.0.0:**
   - In the context of network configurations, 0.0.0.0 is often used as a wildcard address or a placeholder.
   - When used in the context of listening on a network socket, binding to 0.0.0.0 means the server is willing to accept connections from any available network interface (all IPv4 addresses).
   - It is not a valid destination address for regular network communication.

3. **/etc/hosts:**
   - `/etc/hosts` is a plain text file on Unix-like operating systems that maps IP addresses to hostnames. It is used to override the DNS (Domain Name System) for resolving specific hostnames on the local system.
   - It allows users to specify IP-address-to-hostname mappings locally, without consulting an external DNS server.

4. **Displaying Active Network Interfaces:**
   - On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), you can use the `ifconfig` or `ip` command to display active network interfaces.
     ```bash
     ifconfig
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     ip address
     ```
   - On Windows, you can use the `ipconfig` command to display network interface information.
     ```bash
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Another cross-platform option is to use the `netstat` command to display network-related information, including active network connections and listening ports.
     ```bash
     netstat -i
     ```
   - Additionally, on Linux, you can use the `ip link show` command to display active network interfaces.
     ```bash
     ip link show
     ```
