#### Local Area Network (LAN)
- It is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
- It is also typically owned, controlled and managed by a single person or organization.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)
- It is a telecommunication network that extends over a large geographical area.
- The internet is the largest WAN, spanning the earth.
- A network device called a router connect LANs to WAN
- A WAN differs from LAN in several important ways, most arent owned by a single organization. Instead WANS exist under collective or distributed ownership and management.


## Internet
- It is a global system of interconnected computers networks that uses TCP/IP to communicate between networks and devices
- It is a network of networks that consists of public, private, academic, business and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad of array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.
- The internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.


## MAC Address
- A media access control (MAC) address is a string of characters that identifies a device on a network.
- It is tied to a key connection device called the network interface card (NIC)
- NIC is essentially a computer circuit card that makes it possible for your computer to connect to a network. It turns data into electrical signals that can be transmitted over the network.

__Use__
- All devices on the same network subnet have different MAC addresses, MAC addresses are very useful for diagnosing network issues such as problems with IP addresses.
- This is because they never change as opposed to dynamic IP address which can change from time to time .
- On wireless network, a process called MAC filtering is a seccurity measure to prevent unwanted network access by hackers and intruders. In MAC address filtering, the router is configured to accept traffic only from specific MAC addresses

__Note:__ IP address represent software and a MAC address represents hardware.


## IP address
- It is a unique number assigned to every machine on the internet.
__IPv4 and IPv6__
- Internet protocol version 4 uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the amount of addresses to 4, 294,967,296 possible unique addresses.
- Internet protocol version 6 changes the address size from 32-bit address to 128-bit addresses
- IP address consists of 4 numbers separated by periods, with the number having possible range from 0 through 255. They are 3 special ranged reserved for special purpose
	- 0.0.0 (The default network)
	- 255.255.255.2555 (broadcast address used for routing)
	- 127.0.0.1 (Loopback address refers t your machine)
